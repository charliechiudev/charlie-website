    "description": "Parkie is a driver’s best mate. Through the GPS localization technology, Parkie recommends all car parks nearby the destination of the user with pricing, opening hours information and most importantly, a vacancy map that will show the number of spots that are available for each level and where they are exactly in a visualised map view which the available spot will be shown in green and red will be shown for the occupied ones. Users would be able to know the real-time availability and which spot they would like to park visually, rather than driving around in every floor and having no luck finding an empty spot especially during peak hours.<br><br>What is more, have you ever experienced forgetting when your parking expires and got a parking fine? Parkie helps the driver to remember where he has parked and what time is his parking time expiring with a 15 or 30 minutes alert in advance if he decides to activate such a service.<br><br>The unique selling proposition of this project is the simplicity of the idea and its realization through an already existing technology." ,

    "description": "The Smart Pet Door is a smart pet flap that works with Artificial Intelligence (AI) visual recognition system. Users would only need to upload a few images of their pets during the setup for machine learning purposes then Smart Pet Door will be able to visually recognize your pets and only open the flap for the authorized pets. User can also monitor and control the door flap via its mobile app. The Smart Pet Door can keep your beloved pets free meanwhile gives you greater security control and avoiding intruders.<br><br>According to RSPCA (Kb.rspca.org.au, 2019), there are more than 24 million pets in Australia - while 38% of households owning a dog and 29% of households owning a cat. It is common for the owners to keep their pets in the yard but a lot of owners would also allow and love their pets to run in the house. No doubt pet door is the solution, however, that also leads to security concerns especially for those who own larger dogs since animal or human intruders can also enter your house easily as your pets do - inspired by the movie “Marmaduke”, a lovable yet naughty giant Great Dane named Marmaduke, always sneak out from the dog flap in the Winslow family and brought a lot of “friends” into the house.<br><br>Currently, there are “smart” pet door products in the market already but they require microchip that is embedded in the pet’s collar for authentication (Surepetcare.com, 2019). While it is also common to own more than one pet, without the need of using any external microchip, our product - The Smart Pet Door works with a visual recognition system for authentication. Owners would only have to upload a few images of the pets during the setup for machine learning. The camera embedded in the top of the door flap detects objects and the flap would be open to certain pets only that have already been identified. Owners can also monitor and control the door flap via its mobile app.<br><br>With the use of Transfer Learning in MobileNet - an efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for mobile vision applications, the machine learning process efficiency has been greatly enhanced. Therefore, only simple set up is required for you to enjoy the innovative Smart Pet Door product.",
