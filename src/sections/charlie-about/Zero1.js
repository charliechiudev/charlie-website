                <p>Charlie's work touches the entire end-to-end journey of a user's interaction - from creating digital assets, research, and prototyping to design and front-end development.</p>
                <p>Having graduated with Dual Bachelor's Degrees in Marketing and IT, Charlie's early career involved corporate marketing in a global Food & Beverage enterprise, branding, and graphic designs for small businesses. She soon realised the inseparable relationship between human-centred design, consumer behaviours, and business goals which is why she started to make use of her logical programming skills from her degree in digital media and user experience design. </p>
                <p>As a tech-savvy and strategic thinker, she enjoys solving problems with her diverse skillsets by experimenting with emerging techs and immersing herself as a user. Her logical thinking skills allow her to understand and execute how a project works exactly from user, technical, design, and business perspectives as well as bringing her own design ideas to life. What is more, the solid marketing & branding experiences she has gained in her early career have helped putting herself in customers' shoes whilst still being creative.</p>
                <p>Charlie is thrilled to join <strong>RMIT University</strong> as a <strong>Digital Media Designer</strong> in 2024. Prior to joining RMIT, Charlie was the Experience & Design Lead at ASPL Group where she first started as a UX/UI designer. ASPL is a management consultancy that provides digital solutions for recruitment, strategic leadership training and development across the Australian government. Within the design & innovation team, Charlie's work focused on creative web/UX/UI design and development, as well as designing optimised users/learners experiences with innovative digital products.
</p>
                <p>Outside of work, you will catch Charlie behind the drum kit, unleashing her inner rockstar. Beyond pixels and beats, you will find her on sci-fi binges or tackling DIY craft projects during the weekends. She is also keen on learning new languages and currently dabbling in Italian too - perch√© no?
